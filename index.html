            JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to
            implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does
            more than just sit there and display static information for you to
            look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps,
            animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can
            bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of
            the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (<a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML"
              >HTML</a
            >
            and
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS">CSS</a
            >) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the
            Learning Area.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give
              meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs,
              headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the
              page.
            </li>
            <li>
              CSS is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to
              our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts,
              and laying out our content in multiple columns.
            </li>
            <li>
              JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create
              dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images,
              and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is
              amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

          <p>
            The core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common
            programming features that allow you to do things like:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for
              instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then store that name
              in a variable called <var>name</var>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming).
              In the above example we take the string "Player 1: " and join it
              to the <var>name</var> variable to create the complete text label,
              e.g. ''Player 1: Chris".
            </li>
            <li>
              Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web
              page. We used a
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event"
                >click</a
              >
              event in our example above to detect when the button is clicked
              and then run the code that updates the text label.
            </li>
            <li>And much more!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            What is even more exciting however is the functionality built on top
            of the client-side JavaScript language. So-called
            <strong>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</strong> provide
            you with extra superpowers to use in your JavaScript code.
          </p>
          <p>
            APIs are ready-made sets of code building blocks that allow a
            developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard or
            impossible to implement. They do the same thing for programming that
            ready-made furniture kits do for home building — it is much easier
            to take ready-cut panels and screw them together to make a bookshelf
            than it is to work out the design yourself, go and find the correct
            wood, cut all the panels to the right size and shape, find the
            correct-sized screws, and then put them together to make a
            bookshelf.
          </p>
          <p>They generally fall into two categories.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Browser APIs</strong> are built into your web browser, and
            are able to expose data from the surrounding computer environment,
            or do useful complex things.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Third party APIs</strong> are not built into the browser by
            default, and you generally have to grab their code and information
            from somewhere on the Web.
          </p>
          <p>
            There's a lot more available, too! However, don't get over excited
            just yet. You won't be able to build the next Facebook, Google Maps,
            or Instagram after studying JavaScript for 24 hours — there are a
            lot of basics to cover first. And that's why you're here — let's
            move on!
          </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="What_is_JavaScript_doing_on_your_page?">
        <header>What is JavaScript doing on your page?</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Here we'll actually start looking at some code, and while doing so,
            explore what actually happens when you run some JavaScript in your
            page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's briefly recap the story of what happens when you load a web
            page in a browser (first talked about in our
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/How_CSS_works#how_does_css_actually_work"
              >How CSS works</a
            >
            article). When you load a web page in your browser, you are running
            your code (the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) inside an execution
            environment (the browser tab). This is like a factory that takes in
            raw materials (the code) and outputs a product (the web page).
          </p>
          <p>
            A very common use of JavaScript is to dynamically modify HTML and
            CSS to update a user interface, via the Document Object Model API
            (as mentioned above). Note that the code in your web documents is
            generally loaded and executed in the order it appears on the page.
            Errors may occur if JavaScript is loaded and run before the HTML and
            CSS that it is intended to modify. You will learn ways around this
            later in the article, in the Script loading strategies section.
          </p>
          <h3>Browser security</h3>
          <p>
            Each browser tab has its own separate bucket for running code in
            (these buckets are called "execution environments" in technical
            terms) — this means that in most cases the code in each tab is run
            completely separately, and the code in one tab cannot directly
            affect the code in another tab — or on another website. This is a
            good security measure — if this were not the case, then pirates
            could start writing code to steal information from other websites,
            and other such bad things.
          </p>
          <h3>JavaScript running order</h3>
          <p>
            When the browser encounters a block of JavaScript, it generally runs
            it in order, from top to bottom. This means that you need to be
            careful what order you put things in. For example, let's return to
            the block of JavaScript we saw in our first example:
          </p>
          <div class="egBox">
            <code>
              <pre>
      const para = document.querySelector('p');
      
      para.addEventListener('click', updateName);
      
      function updateName() {
        let name = prompt('Enter a new name');
        para.textContent = 'Player 1: ' + name;
      }
              </pre>
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            Here we are selecting a text paragraph (line 1), then attaching an
            event listener to it (line 3) so that when the paragraph is clicked,
            the <code>updateName()</code> code block (lines 5–8) is run. The
            <code>updateName()</code> code block (these types of reusable code
            blocks are called "functions") asks the user for a new name, and
            then inserts that name into the paragraph to update the display.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you swapped the order of the first two lines of code, it would no
            longer work — instead, you'd get an error returned in the browser
            developer console — TypeError: para is undefined. This means that
            the para object does not exist yet, so we can't add an event
            listener to it.
          </p>
          <h3>Interpreted versus compiled code</h3>
          <p>
            You might hear the terms <strong>interpreted</strong> and
            <strong>compiled</strong> in the context of programming. In
            interpreted languages, the code is run from top to bottom and the
            result of running the code is immediately returned. You don't have
            to transform the code into a different form before the browser runs
            it. The code is received in its programmer-friendly text form and
            processed directly from that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compiled languages on the other hand are transformed (compiled) into
            another form before they are run by the computer. For example, C/C++
            are compiled into machine code that is then run by the computer. The
            program is executed from a binary format, which was generated from
            the original program source code.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a lightweight interpreted programming language. The
            web browser receives the JavaScript code in its original text form
            and runs the script from that. From a technical standpoint, most
            modern JavaScript interpreters actually use a technique called
            <strong>just-in-time compiling</strong> to improve performance; the
            JavaScript source code gets compiled into a faster, binary format
            while the script is being used, so that it can be run as quickly as
            possible. However, JavaScript is still considered an interpreted
            language, since the compilation is handled at run time, rather than
            ahead of time.
          </p>
          <h3>Server-side versus client-side code</h3>
          <p>
            You might also hear the terms <strong>server-side</strong> and
            <strong>client-side</strong> code, especially in the context of web
            development. Client-side code is code that is run on the user's
            computer — when a web page is viewed, the page's client-side code is
            downloaded, then run and displayed by the browser. In this module we
            are explicitly talking about
            <strong>client-side JavaScript</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Server-side code on the other hand is run on the server, then its
            results are downloaded and displayed in the browser. Examples of
            popular server-side web languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, ASP.NET
            and... JavaScript! JavaScript can also be used as a server-side
            language, for example in the popular Node.js environment — you can
            find out more about server-side JavaScript in our Dynamic Websites –
            Server-side programming topic.
          </p>
          <h3>Dynamic versus static code</h3>
          <p>
            The word <strong>dynamic</strong> is used to describe both
            client-side JavaScript, and server-side languages — it refers to the
            ability to update the display of a web page/app to show different
            things in different circumstances, generating new content as
            required. Server-side code dynamically generates new content on the
            server, e.g. pulling data from a database, whereas client-side
            JavaScript dynamically generates new content inside the browser on
            the client, e.g. creating a new HTML table, filling it with data
            requested from the server, then displaying the table in a web page
            shown to the user. The meaning is slightly different in the two
            contexts, but related, and both approaches (server-side and
            client-side) usually work together.
          </p>
          <p>
            A web page with no dynamically updating content is referred to as
            <strong>static</strong> — it just shows the same content all the
            time.

            JavaScript is applied to your HTML page in a similar manner to CSS.
            Whereas CSS uses <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> elements to apply
            external stylesheets and <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> elements to
            apply internal stylesheets to HTML, JavaScript only needs one friend
            in the world of HTML — the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element.
            Let's learn how this works.

        <header>Comments</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            As with HTML and CSS, it is possible to write comments into your
            JavaScript code that will be ignored by the browser, and exist to
            provide instructions to your fellow developers on how the code works
            (and you, if you come back to your code after six months and can't
            remember what you did). Comments are very useful, and you should use
            them often, particularly for larger applications. There are two
            types:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A single line comment is written after a double forward slash
              (//), e.g.
              <div class="egBox">
                <code>
                  <pre>      // I am a comment </pre>
                </code>
              </div>
            </li>
            <li>
              A multi-line comment is written between the strings /* and */,
              e.g.
              <div class="egBox">
                <code>
                  <pre>
      /*
        I am also
        a comment
      */            
                </pre
                  >
                </code>
              </div>

            So there you go, your first step into the world of JavaScript. We've
            begun with just theory, to start getting you used to why you'd use
            JavaScript and what kind of things you can do with it. Along the
            way, you saw a few code examples and learned how JavaScript fits in
            with the rest of the code on your website, amongst other things.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript may seem a bit daunting right now, but don't worry — in
            this course, we will take you through it in simple steps that will
